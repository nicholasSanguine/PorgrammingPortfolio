-Original Demo Plan-
Taking Bullet Physics in Unity and painting material stress on the item.
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/bullet-physics-for-unity-62991 <- check it out
Goal: 10 second video to roll on repeat in the background
Link to the build for people to run it.

How do we get there?
1. Learn how to dynamically paint the meshes to begin with
2. I am going to end up doing a writeup on material stresses
3. Take information from a wide variety of verteces within the meshes.
4. Make the user be able to build something with it.
